# Cinder-GstSyncedPlayer

A cinder block for playing back videos in sync over the network with GStreamer.
Ported from Petros Kataras's ofxGstVideoSyncPlayer https://github.com/PetrosKataras/ofxGstVideoSyncPlayer. 

Currently just working with the custom Gstreamer branch found here: https://github.com/patrickFuerst/Cinder/tree/gstreamer
